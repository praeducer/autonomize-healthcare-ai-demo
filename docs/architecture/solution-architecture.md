## 1. System Description

A large US-based health plan integrates **Autonomize AI's PA Copilot** into its existing IT environment to automate the intake, clinical review, and determination of prior authorization (PA) requests. The solution uses **AI-driven clinical review** with configurable confidence thresholds and mandatory human oversight, deployed on **Microsoft Azure** to align with Autonomize AI's platform and cloud strategy.

### What the system does:
1. **Receives** PA requests from providers via fax, web portal, and X12 278 EDI
2. **Processes** unstructured documents (OCR, extraction) into structured PA records
3. **Validates** member eligibility and PA requirements against the payer core system
4. **Retrieves** clinical data from FHIR R4 endpoints and legacy databases
5. **Reviews** clinical evidence against coverage criteria using AI (Autonomize PA Copilot + Claude)
6. **Routes** determinations based on AI confidence: auto-approve (high), human review (low), pend for info (insufficient)
7. **Records** every decision with full audit trail for HIPAA and CMS-0057-F compliance

### What the system does NOT do:
- Replace clinical reviewers — AI augments human judgment
- Auto-deny PA requests (Phase 1) — all denials require human clinical review
- Implement FHIR Da Vinci Implementation Guide internals — FHIR R4 is the interoperability label
- Replace the Payer Core System — integrates alongside it

## 4. PA Business Process (Standard Flow)

The system follows the standard PA business process as defined by AMA, CAQH, and CMS — technology innovation is in the execution, not the process.

1. **Provider submits PA request** (fax, portal, or X12 278 EDI)
2. **Intake and normalization** — document processing converts to structured record
3. **Eligibility verification** — confirm member is covered, service requires PA
4. **Clinical data retrieval** — gather relevant clinical records from FHIR and legacy sources
5. **AI clinical review** — match clinical evidence against coverage criteria, assess medical necessity
6. **Confidence-based routing**:
   - High confidence approval → auto-approve
   - Low confidence → human clinical reviewer queue
   - Insufficient data → pend and request more information from provider
7. **Human review** (when routed) — reviewer sees AI recommendation + evidence, confirms or overrides
8. **Determination response** — write to Payer Core, notify provider
9. **Audit logging** — every step recorded with reasoning for compliance

## 5. Three Deep Integration Points

### Integration 1: Member Eligibility API
- **Direction**: Bidirectional (read eligibility, write determination)
- **Protocol**: REST API to Payer Core System
- **Auth**: Service account with least privilege, mutual TLS
- **Data**: Member ID → eligibility status, benefit details, PA requirement flag, contract rules
- **Latency**: <2 seconds (synchronous, blocking)
- **Caching**: Azure Cache for Redis (TTL: 15 minutes) to reduce Payer Core load

### Integration 2: PA Request Ingestion (One Format Focus: Fax)
- **Direction**: Inbound
- **Protocol**: Fax gateway (SFTP) → Azure Blob Storage → Document Processing Pipeline
- **Processing**: Azure AI Document Intelligence (OCR) → structured extraction → canonical PA record
- **Security**: TLS in transit, encrypted at rest, PHI handling per HIPAA
- **Challenge**: Handwritten clinical notes — OCR accuracy varies; low-confidence extractions flagged for manual review
- **Output**: Normalized JSON PA record on Azure Service Bus for downstream processing

### Integration 3: Clinical Data for AI Processing
- **Direction**: Read-only from clinical sources
- **Sources**: FHIR R4 endpoints (modern EMRs) + Legacy DB connectors (older systems)
- **Protocol**: FHIR R4 REST API (OAuth 2.0) for modern; database connector (service account + VNet) for legacy
- **Standardization**: All clinical data normalized to FHIR R4-compatible format before AI processing
- **Security boundary**: PHI tokenized before passing to LLM; only necessary clinical context included
- **FHIR Resources used**: Patient, Encounter, Observation, DiagnosticReport, Condition

## 7. Open Questions for Real Discovery

These are questions a thorough SA would ask before committing to implementation. Framing them shows the panel that Paul understands what requires real client engagement.

### Ask Early (impacts architecture):
1. What is the actual monthly PA volume and channel distribution?
2. Which Payer Core System is deployed (TriZetto Facets, QNXT, custom)?
3. What Autonomize platform components are currently licensed/available?
4. What is the current FHIR R4 adoption percentage across clinical data sources?
5. Are there existing cloud commitments or multi-cloud requirements?

### Ask During Design (impacts integration):
6. What is the Payer Core System API interface specification?
7. Which clinical guidelines are used (InterQual, MCG, custom)?
8. What is the current auto-approval rate without AI?
9. What confidence threshold is acceptable for auto-determination?
10. How are PA denials currently reviewed and appealed?

### Ask Before Go-Live (impacts operations):
11. What is the clinical reviewer team size and workflow?
12. What are the state-specific PA requirements beyond CMS-0057-F?
13. What is the regulatory/legal position on AI-assisted auto-denial?
14. How should the system behave during Autonomize platform outages?
15. What SLAs does the Payer Core System API guarantee?

| Electronic PA cost (payer) | ~$0.05 per transaction | Same |
| Payer savings per automated PA | $3.47 per transaction | $3.52 − $0.05 = $3.47 |

> **CAQH methodology**: Costs are weighted average **labor costs** (salaries + wages + benefits + overhead) per transaction, measured via annual provider/plan survey. Excludes technology/system costs and time spent gathering information. The $10.97 provider figure and $3.52 payer figure reflect the same methodology applied to each side of the transaction.

> **Data vintage**: Per-transaction costs are from the **2024 CAQH Index** (2023 data) — the most recent with publicly verifiable per-transaction figures.
