# Slide Generation Prompts for Claude for PowerPoint

Each prompt below generates one slide. Use with the Claude for PowerPoint add-in.

**Workflow:**
1. Open [presentation.md](presentation.md) — this is the single source of truth for all slide content
2. For each slide, paste the corresponding prompt into Claude for PowerPoint
3. The prompt references `presentation.md` as context — attach it or paste the relevant slide section when prompted

**Tip:** If Claude for PowerPoint supports file attachment, attach `presentation.md` once at the start of your session and reference slide numbers in each prompt. This avoids repeating content.
